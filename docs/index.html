      <p>The Rust Language Server or RLS provides a server that runs in the
background, providing IDEs, editors, and other tools with information about
Rust programs. It supports functionality such as 'goto definition', symbol
search, reformatting, and code completion, and enables renaming and
refactorings. The RLS gets its source data from the compiler and from Racer.
Where possible it uses data from the compiler which is precise and complete.
Where its not possible, (for example for code completion and where building is
too slow), it uses Racer.</p>

<p>Since the Rust compiler does not yet support end-to-end incremental
compilation, we can't offer a perfect experience. However, by optimising our
use of the compiler and falling back to Racer, we can offer a pretty good
experience for small to medium sized crates. As the RLS and compiler evolve,
we'll offer a better experience for larger and larger crates.</p>

<p>The RLS is designed to be frontend-independent. We hope it will be widely
adopted by different editors and IDEs.</p>
