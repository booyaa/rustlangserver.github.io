<h1>Visual Studio Code</h1>

<p>To setup Visual Studio Code to use RLS, you need to install the <a
href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust">Rust (rls)</a> extension.</p>

<p>You can do this using the command pallette
<pre class="snippet"><span>ext install rust</span></pre>
</p>

<p>If you don't have the nightly version of rust or RLS installed the extension will
offer to install it for you.</p>
