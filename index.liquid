<h1>The Rust IDE and editor setup guide</h1>

<p>The Rust Language Server (RLS) provides a standard interface for IDEs,
editors and tools to interact with Rust. For users it's a hassle free
way to get Rust to work with your favourite IDE or editor.</p>

<p>If you haven't already picked an editor, we recommend you use 
<a href="http://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> as this has 
the smoothest user experience and is being actively developed by the team 
behind RLS.</p>

<h1>Do you use another editor?</h1>

<p>Here are setup instructions for other editors.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#neovim">Neovim</a></li>    
    <li>Atom</li> 
    <li>gnome builder</li> 
    <li>emacs</li> 
    <li>eclipse</li> 
</ul>

<!-- HACK: bit of white space so last editor doesn't get mudged up with the previous one -->
